## üîç OramaSearch Setup

To use ArticleVault, you need to set up an OramaSearch index with the correct schema. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new index in your OramaSearch dashboard
2. Use the following schema for your index:

```json
{
  "url": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "author": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "created_at": "string",
  "description": "string"
}
```

3. Make sure to enable full-text search for the `content` field
4. For better search results, you may want to enable vector search on relevant fields like `title`, `author`, and `description`

This schema allows ArticleVault to store and search through your saved articles efficiently. Each field serves a specific purpose:

- `url`: The web address of the saved article
- `title`: The title of the article
- `content`: The raw text content scraped from the article
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when the article was saved
- `author`: The author of the article (if available, taken from metadata)
- `description`: A brief description or summary of the article (if available, taken from metadata)
